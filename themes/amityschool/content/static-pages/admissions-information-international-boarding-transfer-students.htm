<p><strong><u>International &amp; Boarding</u><br></strong></p>

<p><strong>Brooklyn Amity School enrolls <u>International Students</u> and provides <u>Boarding&nbsp;</u>(for International &amp; Domestic High School Girls; <em>only).</em> The international enrollment process includes some documents that are required to be completed in a timely fashion. &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>We are, perhaps, the only private school in Brooklyn that assists with the I-20 issuance and Student-Visa Acquisition process (for International students interested in both boarding/non-boarding options).&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>International students have the option to apply to Brooklyn Amity as a International/Boarding student or as a International/Non-Boarding student (whereas you will not be living on campus but rather with a relative in the New York City area). Below, you will find our international student enrollment packet. Please review &amp; complete the packet in addition to following the standard application process. <br></strong></p>

<p><strong>Those interested in boarding domestically can follow the standard application process. Again, our boarding-offerings are limited to high school girls at this time.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>Transfer Students (Domestic - U.S.)</u></strong></p>

<p><strong>Students who wish to transfer to Brooklyn Amity will be considered on a rolling-basis and must follow the standard application process.&nbsp;</strong></p>
