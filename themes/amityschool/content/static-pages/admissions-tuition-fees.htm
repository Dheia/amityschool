<p>To complete the registration process, Brooklyn Amity School requires a <strong>10% enrollment payment&nbsp;</strong>that will serve to confirm your child's seat in their grade/class. The initial $50 application-fee will also be allocated toward that initial installment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each family will then be billed for the <strong>remaining tuition-balance over the course of 9-months(September-May)</strong>. Families who opt for a 'one-time or 'semi-annual' payment-plan will be eligible to receive a designated tuition-discount. Please email our finance department, for details. <a href="mailto:finance@amityschool.org">finance@amityschool.org</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
