<p align="center">OPENING GUIDELINES</p>

<p align="center">FOR 2021 - 2022 SCHOOL YEAR</p>

<p align="center">BAS will continue to have 5 days in person education, on campus for 2021-2022 academic year. School opens on 13th of September for all students.</p>

<p align="center">Our main goal at BAS is to continue to provide our students with quality instruction in the 2021-2022 school year in alignment with our mission and vision. In this document, we will outline our current planning for the 2021-2022 school year. Our intent is to provide 5 days in-person on campus. We also provide Online Education for every level. We will work to provide this instruction while also keeping our students, staff, and community safe. We will be adhering to any applicable public health orders, which continue to be released. This plan is based on the possibility of two different options.</p>

<p align="center">Option 1: On Campus Education - Health and safety guidelines allow for schools to open and continue daily learning with certain requirements. Our students will have classes in person on campus for 5 days. There will be safe spacing between desks and average student in a classroom will be around 8 to 15. This is our initial plan.</p>

<p align="center">Option 2: Online Education – Should government officials require a shelter-in-place or quarantine situation, BAS will shift to the improved online learning education for all schools.</p>

<p align="center">FACILITY CLEANING, DISINFECTING, AND ENHANCEMENTS</p>

<p align="center">Frequent and regular cleaning and disinfecting will be a vital part of our operation during Covid-19.</p>

<p align="center">BAS has a team to clean and disinfect our campus every day in detail using EPA-approved products that are effective for Covid-19. That service will continue with further attention to the cleaning and disinfecting of frequently touched surfaces by students such as doorknobs, student desks, and chairs.</p>

<p align="center">Touchless hand sanitizers with 60% alcohol rate will be available in areas which are used by middle and high school students for its effectiveness with Covid-19. Elementary students are discouraged to use these hand sanitizers as it may not be healthy for their skin. Instead, elementary students are encouraged to use soap and water. Air dryers in restrooms are powerful models to allow students to easily dry their hands after using soap and water.</p>

<p align="center">We have worked with our building contractor to ensure best practices with our AC and ventilation systems.</p>

<p align="center">In addition, we are reducing areas requiring frequent touch. All water fountains are being converted to touchless. Therefore, students are encouraged to bring their own water bottle that can be refilled throughout the day. There will be hand sanitizer station next to vending machines.</p>

<p align="center">OPERATIONAL ADJUSTMENTS</p>

<p align="center">Students will be instructed on our safety policies and teachers and staff will assimilate them into daily routines. Signs providing reminders of safety procedures will be displayed throughout the building. Reminders will be added to News Letters so that students and families can become familiar with the new guidelines and comfortable in their use.</p>

<p align="center">Classroom Adjustments</p>

<p align="center">Students in Elementary will remain with the same classrooms for the duration of the day to minimize unnecessary exposure. Students in HS and MS are unable to stay with the same groups due to scheduling; however, all safety procedures will be followed during the school day. Students and Staff will be wearing masks during the stay on campus.</p>

<p align="center">Safety Signs</p>

<p align="center">To ensure safe travel in the building, traffic flow patterns will be visible and students will be instructed to adhere to these guidelines. Additionally, safe space guidelines will be expected at all times (water fountains, front desk, etc). Students will also be expected to maintain safe space in the restrooms; therefore, only a few students will be permitted at any given time. Frequent planned breaks will be scheduled into the day and students rotated.</p>

<p align="center">Lunch Schedule</p>

<p align="center">For all students, lunches will continue to be served in the cafeteria utilizing safe spacing and routine disinfecting. Elementary, Middle and High Schools have different schedules for lunch which allows us to have safe spacing.</p>

<p align="center">Recess Policy</p>

<p align="center">For recess, ES and MS students will have opportunities to play outside in open air areas and safe space distancing will be taught and encouraged. Students will be in smaller groups during recess times (ex: classroom group instead of grade level group).</p>

<p align="center">Restroom Policy</p>

<p align="center">A limited number of students will be permitted to enter the restroom. Maximum capacity signage will be posted and observed. Teachers will be more lenient in terms of ensuring that students will be allowed to use the restrooms throughout the day, however, students who overuse the privilege may be required to bring in a doctor’s note documenting their extenuating conditions.</p>

<p align="center">Locker Policy</p>

<p align="center">HS and MS students will be given lockers. Safe spacing should be maintained.</p>

<p align="center">Only High School Students can bring their Cell phones to school. They can Only use it during their lunch.</p>

<p align="center">CLINIC PROCEDURES FOR COVID-19</p>

<p align="center">BAS has implemented Clinical Health and Safety procedures for its community members, including:</p>

<p align="center">Health Screenings and Symptom Assessment</p>

<p align="center">Procedures for Anyone Experiencing Symptoms</p>

<p align="center">Procedures for Anyone Tested Positive for COVID-19</p>

<p align="center">Procedures for Anyone in Contact with Someone who is Positive for COVID-19</p>

<p align="center">Procedures for Anyone Experiencing COVID-19 Symptoms at School</p>

<p align="center">Health Screenings and Symptom Assessment</p>

<p align="center">We are asking parents/guardians, and all members of the community, to do a self-assessment of themselves and their children, including a temperature check, before leaving home each morning. Please use the self-assessment website below provided by CDC:</p>

<p align="center">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html</p>

<p align="center">Individuals with COVID-19 may have any of the following symptoms, which may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus:</p>

<p align="center">Cough</p>

<p align="center">Shortness of breath</p>

<p align="center">Difficulty breathing</p>

<p align="center">Procedures for Anyone Experiencing Symptoms</p>

<p align="center">Anyone who is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should isolate at home, contact their doctor for medical guidance, and inform the school nurse immediately. If a test is deemed necessary by the physician and a positive result is received, please follow the guidelines outlined by your physician and our Procedures for Anyone Tested Positive for COVID-19 outlined below. If a negative test result is received, please follow the guidelines outlined by your physician and provide proper documentation before being allowed to return to campus. If a test is deemed unnecessary by the physician, a written physician’s release will be required to return to campus along with meeting the following requirements:</p>

<p align="center">Fever and fever-medication-free for at least 72 hours, AND</p>

<p align="center">Other symptoms have improved</p>

<p align="center">Procedures for Anyone Tested Positive for COVID-19</p>

<p align="center">Anyone tested positive for COVID-19, should isolate and inform the school nurse immediately. A negative COVID-19 test AND a written physician’s release will be required before anyone can return to school.</p>

<p align="center">Stay home. Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. Do not leave your home, except to get medical care. Do not visit public areas.</p>

<p align="center">Take care of yourself. Get rest and stay hydrated.</p>

<p align="center">Stay in touch with your doctor. Call before you get medical care. Be sure to get care if you have trouble breathing, or have any other emergency warning signs, or if you think it is an emergency.</p>

<p align="center">If we have a determination of a Covid-19 case at our school, all related rooms will be closed and related students will be asked to continue their education through online school. Our cleaning team will wait as long as practical (about 24 hours) before beginning cleaning and disinfection to minimize potential for exposure to respiratory droplets. Then those areas will be cleaned and disinfected for two days in a row. On the fourth school day, classroom may be used.</p>

<p align="center">Procedures for Anyone in Contact with Someone who is Positive for COVID-19</p>

<p align="center">All students and employees should isolate at home and contact their doctor for medical guidance, if they have had close contact with a person with COVID-19. CDC currently defines https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/principles-contact-tracing.html “close contact” as “someone who was within six feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes starting from 48 hours before illness onset until the time the patient is isolated.”</p>

<p align="center">Vaccinated people do not need quarantine unless they are tested positive. For more details, see CDC guidelines.</p>

<p align="center">Employees and parents/guardians are asked to self-report to the school nurse. A written physician’s release will be required for return. During this time, individuals should also stay away from anyone who is at higher risk for getting sick.</p>

<p align="center">Procedures for Anyone Experiencing COVID-19 Symptoms at School</p>

<p align="center">If a student is sick or experiencing symptoms at school, the student will report to Nurse Office. If deemed necessary, the student will be isolated. In the isolation room, everyone will be provided a face covering and social distancing, and the parents will be informed right away. If not deemed necessary, then the student will be taken to the clinic for regular checks and regular clinic procedures will be followed.</p>

<p align="center">Employees who become sick or experience symptoms while at the school should follow the same procedures as students.</p>

<p align="center">On-Campus Periodic Screening Process</p>

<p align="center">First of all, it is very important that each family conduct a self-assessment before leaving home each morning. Periodic health screenings of students and employees may be conducted including random temperature checks. All Students and Staff will be screened every morning at the entrance. Students and employees with COVID-19 symptoms or a temperature of 100.0 and above will be immediately isolated and sent home.</p>

<p align="center">Protecting Yourself and Others</p>

<p align="center">To maintain a safe environment for everyone on campus, the school is implementing basic infection prevention measures for everyone to follow. These include, but are not limited to, the promotion of handwashing and respiratory etiquette, use of social distancing and optional face coverings.</p>

<p align="center">Vaccination (Covid-19). All staff should be vaccinated or bring weekly PCR test result to the school nurse.</p>

<p align="center">Handwashing. Frequent handwashing is critical in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. The school will provide and maintain touchless soap and/or sanitizer stations. Hand sanitizer dispensers (that use sanitizers of greater than 60 percent alcohol) will be at entrances and other locations throughout the school. All students and school employees are instructed to frequently wash their hands throughout the day for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, but especially at the beginning and end of their work day, before and after mealtimes, and after using the restroom. The use of soap and water is the best option, especially if hands are visibly dirty. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.</p>

<p align="center">Respiratory etiquette. Employees, parents, students, and visitors should cover their mouth and nose with their sleeve or a tissue when coughing or sneezing and to avoid touching their face, in particular their mouth, nose, and eyes, with their hands. They should dispose of tissues in provided trash receptacles and immediately hand sanitizer, and or wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Respiratory etiquette signage will be displayed throughout the school.</p>

<p align="center">Social distancing. Social distancing requirements will be communicated with school community members based on the current phase of the Federal School Opening Guidelines at the time of school opening in September. In classrooms, between students, it is 3 feet as of August, 2021.</p>

<p align="center">Face coverings. A face covering is a must while on campus and is obliged to be worn by employees, students, parents, and visitors whenever feasible. According to public health officials, individuals can spread COVID-19 to others even if they do not feel sick, and wearing face coverings mitigates this risk.</p>

<p align="center">CDC guidelines also provide general considerations for wearing and maintaining a face covering, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/cloth-face-coverings-information.pdf</p>

<p align="center">including the following:</p>

<p align="center">The mouth and nose are fully covered</p>

<p align="center">The covering fits snugly against the sides of the face so there are no gaps</p>

<p align="center">The wearer does not have any difficulty breathing while wearing the covering</p>

<p align="center">The face covering can be tied or otherwise secured to prevent slipping</p>

<p align="center">ONLINE MODEL INSTRUCTION</p>

<p align="center">Should government officials require a shelter-in-place or quarantine situation, BAS will shift to the improved online learning education for all schools.</p>

<p align="center">Schedules – In case of online education will be implemented, based on our last year experiences, we will announce the schedules for all schools. This will be mostly the same schedule with on campus.</p>
