<p><strong>We offer superb guidance through a well-designed partnership with parents, students, teachers and staff. Dedicated teachers motivate the students beyond the standard curriculum and challenge the students to bring out their best inner self.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Brooklyn Amity is located in the heart of New York, which allows the students to explore and take advantage of everything that New York City has to offer (field trips, community initiatives, intensive/interactive learning, etc). We also provide students with a safe and nurturing environment which allows them to fully concentrate on their academic achievements and personal growth. Student-life at Brooklyn Amity is also a vital part of our success. Students are given an opportunity to participate in many clubs and activities such as Science Olympiad, Robotics, Athletics, Amity Outreach, Student Council, Math Olympiad, Band/Ensemble, Chorus, Chess, Drama, and Dance, to name a few. This allows students the opportunity to be fully engaged and enjoy their time at our school.&nbsp;</strong></p>

It provides the students the option to earn college credits while attending high school through a carefully designed individual four year plan implemented to allow students to take the courses best suited to their individual needs.&nbsp;</strong></p>
