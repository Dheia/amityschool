<p><strong>Middle School (Gr. 6-8) is a time of transition. As students become more mature, they increase in their ability to be independent thinkers and learners. Brooklyn Amity's middle school program is designed to encourage students to take responsibility for their education and prepare them for the challenges of high school.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Brooklyn Amity School is one of the leading private middle schools (Gr. 6-8) in Brooklyn and truly prides itself on its ability to help students discover their uniqueness (as individuals) and value contributing to a community (as a whole). The middle years of education play an essential role in an adolescent's life and will heavily dictate who they become in years thereafter. Brooklyn Amity not only provides high-quality education, but we also help students by counseling session.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Our conducive learning environment and innovative programs (American Sign Language, Computers/Technology, Spanish) all serve to foster hidden-talent (&amp; interests) among students. Middle School students also sit for the NYS Math, ELA, and Science (Gr. 8 only) examinations. For middle school students, Brooklyn Amity is an institution where students receive ultimate exposure to grow their skills.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We value everyone’s dream and reinforce the progress of students because we know knowledge (and the support of one's growth) transforms dreams into reality. A number of our students prepare for the SHSAT and have gained acceptance (and have gone on) to a number of specialized public high schools in the New York City area. Middle school students flourish in our after-school enrichment program with leisure and competitive programs such as:</strong></p>

<p><strong>- Math Olympiad</strong></p>

<p><strong>- Band/Ensemble</strong></p>

<p><strong>- Chorus</strong></p>

<p><strong>- Drama</strong></p>

<p><strong>- Science Olympiad</strong></p>

<p><strong>- Art Club</strong></p>

<p><strong>- SHSAT Prep</strong></p>
